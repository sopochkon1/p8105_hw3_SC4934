## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

# Dataset description

``` r
skimr::skim(instacart)
```

In the instacart dataset, there are 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with
each row resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables
include identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which
each product was added to the cart. There are several order-level
variables, describing the day and time of the order, and number of days
since prior order. Then there are several item-specific variables,
describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department
(e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits),
and whether the item has been ordered by this user in the past. In
total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
distinct users

there are 134 aisles. The most orders are from the fresh vegetables
aisle (`aisle_id` = 83), with 150609 orders.

## table

this table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and the amount of times each item was ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |

## table 2

this table shows

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

this table shows the mean hour of day at whidh pink apples and coffee
ice cream are ordered on each day of the week. the table was formatted
in an untidy way so it is easier for humans to read. pink lady apples
are mostly ordered earlier in the day than Coffee Ice Cream.

# Problem 2

## load and tidy

``` r
accel_data = 
  read_csv(
  "data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "minutes",
    names_prefix = 'activity_'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekend_vs_weekday = case_when(day == "Saturday"| day == "Sunday" ~ "Weekend", 
    day == "Monday"| day == "Tuesday" | day == "Wednesday" | day =="Thursday" | day == "Friday" ~ "Weekday")
  )
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443

the datasets includes 50400 rows and 6 columns. the character variable
`weekend_vs_weekday` was created. in total, there are 35 days tracked in
the dataset.

## Aggregate table

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(minutes)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total,
  ) %>% 
  select(week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits=2) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|-----:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|

some of the trends show decreased activity during the weekend compared
to the weekdays. For example, activity 4 and 5 are generally lower in
the weekend than the weekdays. activity 1 starts off lower on Monday and
increases steadily during the week.
